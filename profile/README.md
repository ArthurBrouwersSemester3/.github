# About us
We are [Arthur Brouwers](https://github.com/Arthur-Brouwers) better known as gym and [Matthijs Dolmans](https://github.com/MatthijsDolmans) better known as stars.  This project has been made for ICT software third semester at Fontys.

# The idea
Our project idea "gym*stars" is for (potential) gym members with little free time. Potential gym members can view the statistics of how busy it is per day and hour.
Based on that information, they can choose a gym that suits their agenda best.
On the other hand, gym members can also view how busy it is in their specific gym and based on that information see whether it is even worth going to the gym at a specific time.

The application includes 7 graphs per gym. Each day of the week has it's own graph, devided by the opening hours. 

the idea is that paid users get more specific information. So if you have an account, you can see realtime information. 
If you decide to use the free option (no registration would be needed), you will only see average information.
